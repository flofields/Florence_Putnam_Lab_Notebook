# Symbiont Cell Density Counting Madracis decactis Samples 

Only 8 samples will be used (see samples below). The goal is to compare the symbiont counts to the Guava protocol to determine if Gauva can be used as a standard for symbiont counts instead of the Hemocytometer and microscope.
This protocol was adapted from the [Putnam Lab](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/Physiology_Protocols/Cell_Density-Protocol.md)
