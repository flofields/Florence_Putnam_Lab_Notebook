## Library Prep for The ENCORE Priming Project 



| Sample ID | TS RNA (ng/uL) | Strip tube # | RNA (uL) | Ultrapure water (uL) | Total starting volume (ul) | Primer |

### Materials 

- [Zymo-Seq SwitchFree 3' mRNA Library Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-switchfree-3-mrna-library-kit)
- PCR tubes (4 per sample)
- Thermocycler 
- Mini centrifuge
- Aluminum beads (to keep things on ice)
- Magnetic stand for PCR tubes

### Buffer preperation 

This step only needs to be done once a new kit is opened. 

- Add 300 uL of the Select-a-Size MagBead concentrate to 10 mL of Select-a-Size MagBead Buffer. 
	- These should be prepared at least 3-5 days ahead of library prep. 
- Add 24 mL of 100% ethanol to the DNA Wash Buffer concentrate. Store at room temperature. 

### Best practices 

- Avoid multiple freeze thaws of all components, and aliquot components as necessary
- Remove enzymes from cold storage just before use and return to cold storage immediately after use
- Thaw and maintain all components on ice unless noted otherwise 
- Flick to mix thawed components and briefly centrifuge prior to use 
- After adding each component, mix by pipetting up and down 15-20 times. Briefly centrifuge after 
- Pre-program thermal cycler with lid heating ON set to >100-105°C 
- Turn on thermocycler day-of to preheat 
- Pre-calculate how much to dilute RNA samples
