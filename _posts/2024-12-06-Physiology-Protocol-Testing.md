# Protein Content of *Madracis decactis* and *Diploria labyrinthiformis* tissue for Physiological Analyses

#### This post entails the date each sample was processed to determine protein concentration using the [Peirce Rapid Gold BCA assay kit](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0017135_PierceRapidGoldBCAProteinAssayKit_UG.pdf). See [HERE]() for the protocol

- Samples were all pratice samples used for protocol practice.
|Samples| Box|
|-------|----|
|DLextra| 5|
|MD-1-31| 5 |
|DL-4-33|5|
|MD-4-35|5|
|MD-1-36|5|

(9 standards + 5 samples) x (2 replicates) x (200 μL of WR) = 5,600μL = 5.6mL WR (Prepare 7)
50 Reagent A:1 Reagent B
7mL:0.14mL

###  20241207

|Samples| Box|
|-------|----|
|DLextra| 5|
|DL-4-33|5|
|MD-4-35|5|
(9 standards + 3 samples) x (2 replicates) x (200 μL of WR) = 4800μL = 4.8mL WR (Prepare 7)
50 Reagent A:1 Reagent B
7mL:0.14mL

Notes: During the peperation step when nutrealizing the NaOH in the sample I used 280uL in the first sample but it was too acidic, I then added 20uL to the second by which it became a pH of 7. For the Third sample I added 20uL then another 20 after testing it then it became to acid reaching at a pH of 5

## Test #3
All test samples were extras which were from Timepoint 4
|Samples| Airbrush Date|Tank|
|-------|--------------|----|
|DLextra| 20241016     |4   |
|MD-4-27| 20241017     |5   |
|DL-3-27| 20241025     |6   |
|MD-1-36| 20241016     |3   |
|DL-3-30| 20241017     |5   |
|MD-2-35| 20241022     |2   |
|DL-4-33| 20241022     |3   |

Added 10uL of NaOH; all samples had a pH of 10~
[Samples at pH 10](https://github.com/flofields/Florence_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/379eebd5cfcc0e4aa3ad2ee7ea582c22aa4cdecd/images/ENCORE/Priming_Experiment/Protein_pH10_3.jpg)

(9 standards + 7 samples) x (2 replicates) x (200 μL of WR) = 6400μL = 6.4mL WR (Prepare 7)
50 Reagent A:1 Reagent B
7mL:0.128mL = 7000uL:128uL


#Chlorophyl a & c2 Protocol
See HERE for the protocol used to attain chlorophyll concentrations 
All pratice samples were collected from Timepoint 4

Changes made to the orginal protcol 
- After thawing the sample votex for 15 seconds
- After centrifudge and adding 1mL of Acetone, vortex for more than 15seconds untill as much as the pellet that you possiblily can is disolved.
