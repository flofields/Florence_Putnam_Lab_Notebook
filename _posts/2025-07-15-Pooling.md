## Pooling Libraries using Illumina 

### Protocols used 

[Best practices for manually normalizing library concentrations](https://knowledge.illumina.com/library-preparation/general/library-preparation-general-reference_material-list/000001252)

This post details the protocol used to pool the libraries constructed with the use of  the [Zymo-Seq SwitchFree 3' mRNA Library Kit](https://github.com/flofields/Florence_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/5e1bd6a1daa8db6ce40285a804eace80a1039421/protocols/Zymo_seq_switchfree_3_mrna_library_kit.pdf). 
Libraries were normalized to 4nM and pooled. 
Sequencing needs a minumum of 4nM and 30uL 

See [here]() for pools 1 and 2 info


### Steps 

  
- [**Determine the library size**](#DTLS)    
- [**Quanitfy the libraries**](#QTL)  
- [**Plan the dilution calculations**](#PTDC)
- [**Pool the normalized libraries**](#PTNL)  

<a name="DTLS"></a> **Determine the library size**

Determining the library size of the libray of each sample is a way to QC your libraries after constructing them. to do this I used the [Tapestation](https://www.agilent.com/en/product/automated-electrophoresis/tapestation-systems/tapestation-instruments/4200-tapestation-system-228263). This [protocol](https://github.com/flofields/Florence_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/6e9046967846d31b2658908bf7ece3a7d2a67ed0/_posts/2025-06-09-DNA-Tapestation.md)
also shows any possible library issues such as adapter dimers. This was done as a form of QC for all samples. 

<a name="QTL"></a> **Quanitfy the libraries**

Library quantification was done using the [Qbit dsDNA HS](https://github.com/flofields/Florence_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/b7725656ec24e76646ef842d6fc135e1e046528c/_posts/2025-06-29-dsDNA-and-RNA-Qubit-Quantification-Protocol.md) protocol. Library concentration values were converted from ng/uL to nM using the equation below from [illumina's general reference material](https://knowledge.illumina.com/library-preparation/dna-library-prep/library-preparation-dna-library-prep-reference_material-list/000001240).

$$\frac{\text{conc in ng/µL}}{660\,\text{g/mol} \times \text{avg library size in bp}} \times 10^6 = \text{conc in nM}$$

<a name="PTDC"></a> **Plan the dilution calculations**

This step includes the concentration normalization. A minimum if 4nM is required. Dilution can be done using molecular grade water or 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5. Here Molecular grade water was used to dulute all libraries to 4nM using the equation below. See [here]() for concentrations an dilutions.

	(C1)(V1)=(C2)(V2)

<a name="PTNL"></a> **Pool the normalized libraries**
After libraries were all diluted to 4nM the [pool calculator](https://support.illumina.com/help/pooling-calculator/pooling-calculator.htm) was used to determine volume of each library to be used in the pool. For both pools 2uL of each sample was used.Quality control for each pool using the tapestation was done and the pools were quantified using the dsDNA Qbit protocol.

Tapestation Results of both pools found [here](https://github.com/flofields/Coral_Priming_Experiments_Summer_2024/blob/81a2198dbfb46d68bab6794135d67055ed8f6a33/images/D5000_ScreenTape/2025_07_15/pools/2025-07-15-Pools.pdf)

dsDNA Qbit results

|Sample|ng/uL #1|ng/uL #2|ng/uL avg|
|---|--|--|--|
|Standard 1|50.55| | |
|Standard 2|24004.99| |
|Pool 1|1.33|1.30|1.32|
|Pool 2| 1.42|1.41|1.415|

The equation below was then used to convert the conc to nM
$$\frac{\text{conc in ng/µL}}{660\,\text{g/mol} \times \text{avg library size in bp}} \times 10^6 = \text{conc in nM}$$
