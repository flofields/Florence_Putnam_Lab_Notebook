## RNA and DNA Extractions for ENCORE Priming Project

### [Protocol Link](https://github.com/flofields/Florence_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/cebc21eb5df7339f0eb12b5a8dd32e6f5f25e433/_posts/2025-05-08-Protocol-Zymo-Quick-DNA-RNA-Extraction.md) and [Here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

### Extraction of 8 samples from ENCORE Priming Project. These samples were collected in Bermuda in June 2024 for the ENCORE Priming project. There are 100 *Madracis decactis* (MDEC) samples total.

## Samples

These samples are apart of day 4 of processing. Samples were randomly selected out of the 100 total being used for Extractions. Samples were either apart of a three phase priming experiment that included the first stage; Priming where the coral were exposed to 3 treatments high temperature (31ºC), low pH (~7.75) and control (~27ºC)~). The second stage; recovery, where they underwent a week recovery period under control conditions (28ºC). The thrid stage was exposure to a stress which was high temperature (32ºC).

## Notes

- Followed this [protocol](https://github.com/flofields/Florence_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/cebc21eb5df7339f0eb12b5a8dd32e6f5f25e433/_posts/2025-05-08-Protocol-Zymo-Quick-DNA-RNA-Extraction.md) exactly. 
- RNA and DNA were extracted from frozen samples in 1mL of [DNA/RNA shield](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/dna-rna-shield)
- For sample preperation bead beat was used and added to the orginal tube. The sample was then votexed for 1 mintue and spinned downed after.
- Durin the DNA extraction samples were inverted in step 5 not flicked.
- During both extractions samples were eluted in 80uL of Tris or DNase/RNase free water (50uL on the first elution and 30 on the next).

## Qubit Results

- Used Broad range dsDNA and RNA Qubit Protocol [HERE](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/) and [HERE](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-08-Qubit-Protocol.md)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once
- Samples MD-5-26 and MD-1-15 qbit was redone
- 
 RNA Standards: 420.60 (S1) & 8892.55 (S2)

## DNA and RNA Quality Check: Gel, using this [protocol](https://github.com/flofields/Florence_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2025-23-05-Gel-Protocol.md)
- Gel ran on 80V for 45 minutes

Note: DNA sample MD-1-4 dissipated in the gel medium.
