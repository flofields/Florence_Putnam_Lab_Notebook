## Adult Coral RNA and DNA Extraction using the Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA™ Miniprep Plus Kit*

**About** : This post shows the steps taken for RNA/DNA extractions based off of the [Zymo Quick DNA RNA Miniprep Protocol]() and adusted for the Putnam lab specfically for coral extractions by [Dr. Emma L. Strand](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol/),[Dr. Kevin H. Wong](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-13-Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extract-P.astreoides-Genome.md) and [Erin E. Chille](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/). This protocol was modified by [Kristina Terpis](https://github.com/Kterpis/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2021-10-08-20211008-RNA-DNA-extractions-from-E5-project.md) [(*Porites* sp. example)](https://github.com/Kterpis/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-02-01-20220201-ReExtracting-DNA-and-RNA-from-E5-project.md) to extract coral clpppigs from 1mL of [DNA/RNA shield](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/dna-rna-shield) and kept at -80ºC and based off of [Zoe Dellaert's](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/) detailed protocol post for RNAlater.

Goal: To extract high quality gemonic DNA (gDNA) and total RNA from **Madracis decactis** and **Diploria labyrinthiformis** when stored in DNA/RNA shield at -80ºC.

### 2. <a name="Sterilizing Working Area to Maintain an RNAse-free Environment"></a> **Sterilizing Working Area to Maintain an RNAse-free Environment**
- Clean Bench and all working equipment such as pipettes, tip boxes, heating block and centrifuge being used with clean paper towels using cleaning materials in the following order
	- 10% Bleach colution
	- DI water
	- 70% ethanol
	- RNAse cleaner (spray bottle)

### 3. <a name="Reagent Preparation"></a> **Reagent Preparation**

This was my first time opening the kit which meant I had to do reagent prep however this step is only required when opening a new kit.

-  Add 96 mL 100% ethanol to the 24 mL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate before use. Mark **clearly** on the bottle that Ethanol was added. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps.  
-  Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) DNase I as indicated on the vial prior to use. 250U of DNAse I, required 275 uL of DNAse/RNAse free water (provided). Mix by **gentle** inversion. Separated into 4 aliquots to minimize freeze-thaw and stored at -20 ºC.
3. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) Proteinase K as indicated on the vial prior to use. For 20g Proteinase K, add 1040 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. For 5 mg Proteinase K, add 260 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. Mix by vortexing. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps. Store tube at -20 ºC, no need to aliquot.

### 4. <a name="Sample preparation: Adult Fragment Tissue Sample in Zymo DNA/RNA Shield"></a> ** Sample preparation: Adult Fragment Tissue Sample in Zymo DNA/RNA Shield**
- Samples are coral clippings stored in 1mL of [Zymo DNA/RNA shield](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/dna-rna-shield) and kept at -80 ºC. Place on bench top to thaw samples to room temperature (temperature of lab ~22ºC on the clean benchtop (see above). 
Photograph sample tubes to record qualitative qualities such as buffer color and amount of tissue in the tube.

**This protocol will start by taking 300 uL of the DNA/RNA shield from the sample tube into a clean 1.5 mL tube and performing a Proteinase K digestion in a new tube. However, adjustments can be made at this step**
- If the DNA/RNA shield looks very dark only take 150 or 100 uL of the DNA/RNA shield from the sample tube into the new tube and dilute with 150 uL or 200 uL of clean DNA/RNA shield (provided in kit). Proceed as directed.
- If the extraction is not yielding enough DNA or RNA and the DNA/RNA shield looks very light-colored, it could be that the lytic properties of the DNA/RNA shield did not break up the tissue enough to yield enough DNA and RNA from the buffer alone. In this case, you could bead beat this sample using the protocols described by other lab members [Dr. Emma L. Strand](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol/), [Dr. Kevin H. Wong](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-13-Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extract-P.astreoides-Genome.md), and [Kristina Terpis](https://github.com/Kterpis/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-03-03-20220303-RNA-DNA-extractions-for-Maggie-Johnson.md). This bead beating step could be done by adding beads to the original sample tube, or by transferring an aliquot (300 uL) of the DNA/RNA shield from the sample tube along with a clipping of the tissue fragment into a new bead tube. Add 500-700 uL of clean DNA/RNA shield to make up 800 uL - 1 mL for bead-beating and bead beat for 1-2 minutes at maximum speed. Then, centrifuge briefly and take an aliquot of 300 uL from this homogenized mixture into a clean 1.5 mL tube. Proceed as directed.

#### Whole Sanp Frozen Fragment
- label the side of a bead tube with the coral fragment's sample id number, your initials and todays date. Label the cap of the bead tube with the coral sample id number
- 1000uL of DNA/RNA shield to the tube.
- Remove desired fragment from -80ºC freezer.
- Using sterilized clippers, clip off 3-4 small pieces and place all the pieces intothe 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube. DNA/RNA shield needs to cover the fragments.
- Proceed to homogenization steps.
#### Homogenization 
- These steps removed the coral tissue from the skeleton, leaving the skeleton pieces in the bead tube and the supernatant containing degraded tissue and DNA/RNA.
- Vortex the 2mL 0.5mm glass bead tube for 1 mintue. The amount of time for vortexing will depend on the cral skeletal structure and how easily the tissue seperates from the skeleton. Too much vortexing can cause DNA/RNA degradation, too little can result in minimal DNA/RNA yield.
- After vortoxing, check to see if most of the tissue has come off the skeleton and that the DNA/RNA shield has darkened in color.
- Remove supernatant and place in a new 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube and proceed to Proteinase K didestion.

### 5. <a name="Proteinase K Digestion"></a> **Proteinase K Digestion**
- Labelled clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for each sample with sample number and place 300uL of sample in each.
- Save the bead tube with the skeleton fragment and leftover aliquoted supernatant tube in -80 °C freezer as a potential back-up in case the extraction doesn't work. Label 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube as desired. 
- dd 30 µl of PK digestion buffer to each sample tube (1:10 ratio of PK Digestion Buffer:Sample).
- Add 15 µl Proteinase K to each sample tube (1:2 ratio of Proteinase K:PK Digestion Buffer).
- Vortex for 5-10 seconds and spin down.
- Proceed to extraction steps.

## Extraction Content Analysis

These steps analyze the quantity and quality of the DNA/RNA extracted and can be done on a day seperate from the extraction date.

### RNA/DNA Quantity  
Follow Broad Range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/) to analyze sample ++quantity++. Read all samples twice.

### DNA Quality  
If DNA quantity is sufficient (typically >10 ng/µL) follow the Agarose Gel [Protocol](https://github.com/flofields/Florence_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2025-23-05-Gel-Protocol.md) to determine DNA quality. "Good" DNA should form a distinct band a the very top of the gel. See example below:
