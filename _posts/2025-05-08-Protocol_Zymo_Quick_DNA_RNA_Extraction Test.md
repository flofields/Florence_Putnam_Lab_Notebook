## Designing a workflow to create a de novo transcriptome for *Diploria labyrinthiformis*

**About**: This post shows the steps taken for RNA/DNA extractions based off of the [Zymo Quick DNA RNA Miniprep Protocol]() and adusted for the Putnam lab specfically for coral extractions by [Dr. Emma L. Strand](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol/),[Dr. Kevin H. Wong](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-13-Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extract-P.astreoides-Genome.md) and [Erin E. Chille](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/). This protocol was modified by [Kristina Terpis](https://github.com/Kterpis/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2021-10-08-20211008-RNA-DNA-extractions-from-E5-project.md) [(*Porites* sp. example)](https://github.com/Kterpis/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-02-01-20220201-ReExtracting-DNA-and-RNA-from-E5-project.md) to extract coral clpppigs from 1mL of [DNA/RNA shield](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/dna-rna-shield) and kept at -80ºC and based off of [Zoe Dellaert's](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/) detailed protocol post .

Goal: To extract high quality gemonic DNA (gDNA) and total RNA from **Madracis decactis** and **Diploria labyrinthiformis** when stored in DNA/RNA shield at -80ºC.

### 1. <a name="Materials"></a> **Materials and Equipment**
- Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit [HERE](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit) [Protocol Booklet](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/Base_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus_Booklet.pdf)
- Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) [1X buffer](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/tris-edta-1x-solution-ph-8-0-molecular-biology-fisher-bioreagents-3/bp24731#?keyword=BP24731) for DNA elution
- Heating block capable of heating to 70ºC
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Plastics: 5 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample, 2 PCR tubes per sample, several 1000 uL, 200 uL, and 20 uL pipette tips per sample.


### 2. <a name="Sterilizing Working Area to Maintain an RNAse-free Environment"></a> **Sterilizing Working Area to Maintain an RNAse-free Environment**
- Clean Bench and all working equipment such as pipettes, tip boxes, heating block and centrifuge being used with clean paper towels using cleaning materials in the following order
	- 10% Bleach colution
	- DI water
	- 70% ethanol
	- RNAse cleaner (spray bottle)

### 3. Sample preparation: Adult Fragment Tissue Sample in Zymo DNA/RNA Shield
- Samples are coral clippings stored in 1mL of [Zymo DNA/RNA shield](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/dna-rna-shield) and kept at -80 ºC. Place on bench top to thaw samples to room temperature (temperature of lab ~22ºC on the clean benchtop (see above). 

### 4. <a name="Reagent Preparation"></a> **Reagent Preparation**

This was my first time opening the kit which meant I had to do reagent prep however this step is only required when opening a new kit.

-  Add 96 mL 100% ethanol to the 24 mL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate before use. Mark **clearly** on the bottle that Ethanol was added. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps.  
-  Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) DNase I as indicated on the vial prior to use. 250U of DNAse I, required 275 uL of DNAse/RNAse free water (provided). Mix by **gentle** inversion. Separated into 4 aliquots to minimize freeze-thaw and stored at -20 ºC.
3. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) Proteinase K as indicated on the vial prior to use. For 20g Proteinase K, add 1040 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. For 5 mg Proteinase K, add 260 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. Mix by vortexing. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps. Store tube at -20 ºC, no need to aliquot.

### 5. Proteinase K Digestion

- Labelled 4 clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for each sample with sample number.
