# Symbiont Cell Density Curve
### Measuring concentration of Symbiodiniaceae cells using the GUAVA instrument to obtain a standard curve 

In total 6 samples will be used (3 Madracis decactis and 3 Diploria labrinthiformis). The goal is to obtain a cell density curve using the Guava protocol.
The cell density protocol using the Hemocytometer and microscope was adapted from the [Putnam Lab](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/Physiology_Protocols/Cell_Density-Protocol.md) and the Guava protocol was modified from [Dr. Federica Scucchia](https://fscucchia-labnotebooks.github.io/FScucchia_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/GUAVA-Protocol/)

The Hemocytometer and microscope 

The Millipore Guava easyCyte HT Flow Cytometer located at the URI Coastal Institute Building (Bay Campus).



 
 <a name="HMMMaterials"></a> **Hemocytometer and Microscope Materials**
   - Microscrope
   -  Symbiont cell suspension
   -  Hemocytometer (with included slides)
   -  Glass pipette with bulb
   -  DI Water (for cleaning)
   -  Kimwipes

### <a name="HMMProtocol"></a> **Step 1 - Hemocytometer and Microscope Protocol**
- Clean hemocytometer and slide with DI water by squirting and wiping with a kimwipe. Place on microscope stand, turn on microscope, and visually inspect to make sure no cells are visible on grid.
- Vortex sample to homogenize.
- Use glass pipette to mix sample by pipetting up and down, then take a small amount and load on the first grid on the hemocytometer (a drop should work just fine). Take a new aliquot from sample and place on the other grid (do not fill both grids from same aliquote)
- Using 10x objective, count cells on one grid of the hemocytometer. 
    - Each grid is divided into nine large squares 
    - Count until you reach 100 total cells (or count all squares).
    - Keep track of how many squraes you count.

- *Note: counting should be standardized- compare your first run with someone else to ensure equivalent standards for what consitutes a cell vs. debris. For cells falling exactly on the border of two squares, cells on the left and bottom border should be considered inside of the square, while cells on the top and right border should be considered outside.* 
	- Repeat with other grid of hemocytometer, counting the same number of squares as before.
	- Clean cytometer as before with DI water. Clean glass pipet with a tube of DI water.
	- Repeat above steps twice more for 6 total counts. 
	- *Note: Each count should count the same number of the nine large squares. For example, if the first count for sample X requires 3 squares to reach 100 squares, 3 squares should be counted on all subsequent counts for sample X.*
	- Make sure average # of cells/square is consistent (calculate std dev and coefficient of variation- should be less than 15%).
	- Multiply # of cells/square by 10^4 and the dilution factor to get cells/mL. Normalize to surface area to get cell/surface area.

All specific equipment for use can be found in the GUAVA manual.

- [96 well plates with round bottoms](https://ecatalog.corning.com/life-sciences/b2c/US/en/Microplates/Assay-Microplates/96-Well-Microplates/Corning%C2%AE-96-well-Clear-Polystyrene-Microplates/p/3797)
- 1.5mL tubes
- PBS solution
- capillary cryo tubes
- ICF solution
- Bleach (sodium hypochlorite solution)
- GUAVA easyCheck Kit (contains Guava easyCheck Bead Reagent and Guava Check Diluent)

<a name="GProtocol"></a> **Step 2 - Guava Protocol**

- Thaw coral homogenate aliquot (650uL) and vortex sample for 15 seconds.
- To separate host and algae, centrifuge the 1.5 tube for 4 minutes at 5000rpm at 4°C.
- Remove the supernatant (host tissue) work with pellet (algae).
- Resuspend the algae with 650uL 1XPBS and homogenize.
- Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 5000rpm at 4°C.
- Remove the supernatant.
- Resuspend the algae with 650uL PBS and homogenize.
- Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 5000rpm at 4°C.
- Remove the supernatant thoroughly.
- Resuspend the algae with 650uL PBS and homogenize.
- Make a 25% dilution with PBS (we ran several trials and found that this is the best dilution for coral samples for the GUAVA, 25% sample and 75% PBS, but dilutions between 20% to 50% also work well, depending on how clear the sample looks - very clear sample might need not to be diluted) of each sample, load in triplicates in a 96 wells plate (round bottom), 240 ul per well.
