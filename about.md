Welcome! I am a PhD student at the University of Rhode Island in Biological and Environmental Sciences Department's Evolution and Marine Biology Program in the [Putnum lab](http://putnamlab.com/). My research uses molecular and eco-physiological approches to understand the effects and responses of marine invertebrates to climate change. The goal is that my reseach contributes to the unknown, misunderstandings of general information and contribute to future conservation and sustainablity efforts.
